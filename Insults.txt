001 What smells worse than a goblin? Oh yeah, you!
002 Your mother takes up more tiles than a gelatinous cube!
003 You're going to make an excellent belt!
004 I'm glad you're tall...It means there's more of you I can despise!
005 I don't know whether to use charm person or hold monster!
006 You're the reason baby gnomes cry!
007 Ugh. What the he'll is that all over your face? Oh...its just your face!
008 You are the feces that is created when shame eats too much stupidly!
009 You're like a dragon, only shit!
010 I've seen more threatening geckos!
011 I swear, if you were any worse at this, you'd be doing our job for us!
012 On a scale of 1 - 10, you're proper screwed!
013 Your mother was a kobold and your father smelled of elderberry!
014 You would bore the legs off a village idiot!
015 It gives me a headache just trying to think down to your level!
016 You're not a complete idiot...Some parts are obviously missing!
017 You're like a trained ape, only, without the training!
018 Hey, have you ever been mistaken for a (insert)
019 Well, my time of not taking you seriously is coming to a middle!
020 Your mother's so ugly, folk turn to stone just incase they might happen to catch a glimpse of her face!
021 Some day you'll meet a doppelganger of yourself and be disappointed!
022 Are you always stupid, or are you making a special effort today!
023 Some day you'll go far and I hope you stay there!
024 You're lucky to be born beautiful, unlike me, who was born to be a big liar!
025 I'd like to leave you with one thought...but I'm not sure you have anywhere to put it!
026 So, you're a half (insert), was your mother a spider or is your ass naturally that huge!
027 Your momma's so ugly, clerics try to turn her!
028 Your magic is as bad as your breath!
029 Oh look, both your weapons are tiny!
030 A wet cat is tougher than you!
031 If ignorance is bliss, you must be the happiest person alive!
032 Are you a half orc crossed with a pig? Oh yeah, there are some things a pig wouldn't do!
033 Wow, that's a fat ass. I guess those behind you are gaining cover for this fight!
034 Your Breath would put an otyugh off it's breakfast!
035 I could say you're as ugly as an ogre, but that would be an insult to ogres!
036 I would contact your mother about your death, but I don't speak goblin!
037 Your very existence is an insult to all!
038 You look like the armpit of an unshaven bog hag!
039 You are maggot pie served from a dwarf's codpiece!
040 A goblin with one hand nailed to a tree would be more of a threat than you!
041 You look like a scab on a troll's wart!
042 No loot is worth having to look at you!
043 You are the worst example of your class that I've ever come across!
044 OMG. Why don't you give me your weapon so I can hit myself with it, because that'd be more effective than you trying it!
045 I can tell your reservoir of courage is fed by the tributary running down your leg!
046 I'd insult your parents, but you probably don't know who they are!
047 Well...I have met sharper loaves of bread!
048 Even evard's black tentacles wouldn't touch something as gross as you!
049 Would you like me to remove that curse? Oh my mistake, you were just born that way!
050 There is no beholder's eye in which you are beautiful!
051 Animal friendship was the only way your parents could get puppies to play with you!
052 Your ugly face makes a good argument against raising the dead!
053 When your god put teeth in your mouth, he ruined a perfectly good asshole!
054 Whomever is willing to have sex with you, is just too lazy to jerk off!
055 If your brain exploded, it wouldn't even mess up your hair!
056 Somewhere, Your depriving a village of it's idiot!
057 I'd like to see things from your point of view, but I can't get my head that far up my arse!
058 Could you go get your husband, I don't like fighting ugly women!
059 You call that an attack, I've seen dead kittens hit harder than that!
060 I heard what happened to your mother, it's not everyday your reflection kills you!
061 You look like your mother, and, your mother looks like your father!
062 You're so stupid, if an illithid tried to eat your brain, it would starve to death!
063 What's that smell? I thought breath weapons were suppose to come out of your mouth!
064 I would try to insult your father, but you were probably mistaken for a half orc, and disowned!
065 Did your mother cast a darkness spell to feed you!
066 No wonder you're hiding behind cover, I'd hide too with a face like that!
067 Do you have a pen? Well you'd better get back to it before the farmer knows you are missing!
068 Quick grab some fire...no wait, it's ok, it's not an actual troll!
069 If I were you, I'd go and get my money back for that remove curse spell!
070 OMG. And I thought troglodytes smelt bad!
071 We're you once hit by a melf's acid arrow or have you always looked like a half eaten marrow!
072 Phew! Have you just cast stinking cloud or do you always smell like that!
073 Very impressive, I think I'll hire you out for children's parties!
074 Hey, you pox ridden dung heap, I bet not even a starving vampire would go near you!
075 By looking at you, now I know what you get when you scrape out the bottom of the barrel!
076 I was going to cast detect thoughts, but I don't think I'm going to find anything up there!
077 I wish I still had that blindness spell, then I wouldn't have to endure that face anymore!
078 I was thinking of casting feeblemind, but I doubt it would work on you!
079 Tell me, did you run away from your parents, or did they run away from you!
080 What's the difference between a troll and your mother? One's a stinking ugly monster, and the other is a troll!
081 I was wondering what you are, you're fat enough to be an ogre, but I've never seen an ogre THAT ugly before!
082 Your mother was so stupid, zombies made her a dunce hat!
083 You're like a gnome on stilts, real cute, but it's not working!
084 They say every rose has its thorn, ain't that right, buttercup!
085 I'd say you were a worthy opponent, but I once fought a flumph wielding a dandelion!
086 If this fight gets any harder, I'll have to switch it up to folk music!
087 I'd draw my rapier, but I wouldn't want to make you jealous!
088 Do you know what happens to a (insert) when it fails it's save? Neither do I, but based on what happened to your comrade, my money's on 'dies horribly'!
089 How does it feel that you're not worthy of anyone casting a decent spell on you!
090 One day I'm going to make a ballad of this fight. Tell me your name, I hope it rhymes with horribly slaughtered!
091 Your mother is so fat that making a joke here would detract from the seriousness of her condition!
092 Didn't there used to be like twice as many of you guys? What's up with that, huh!
093 Stop me if you've heard this one. The sole purpose of your existence is to serve as a speedbump on others path to greatness - okay you definitely should of stopped me by now!
094 What's the difference between a dragon and a mallard with a cold? One's a sick duck and I forget the punchline, but your mother's a whore!
095 Wait, wait, I just need to ask, what do you need us to put on your headstone!
096 I've heard of schoolgirls with better fighting skills than you!
097 By the gods your ugly, I bet your father regrets not pulling out when he had the chance!
098 You do know the pointy end is suppose to go in the other guy, right!
099 Do you know, that if you were at a party surrounded by female zombies, the only thing you'd pull is a hamstring!
100 Wait, so you're the manifestation of a divine being of supreme power and malevolence, and you chose that face? Do they even have mirrors on your plane of existence!
101 What smells worse than a dead goblin? A live one!
102 Green skin was sooo last season!
103 You spell like a barbarian! Spell! I said spell! (against a caster/magic user)
104 Your mother takes up more tiles than a gelatinous cube!
105 Ahhh a hideous fiend! Oh wait no, you're just ugly.
106 I've recieved more witty banter from zombies!
107 Ugh. I never thought I'd miss the smell of dwarf! Congratulations. You've gone nose deaf.
108 Biggest Kobold I ever saw(to any reptilian race other than kobold).
109 Damn, you're ugly enough to collect warlock autographs(likening them to a fiend or cthulu).
110 Ugh what the hell is that all over your face? Oh.. that's just your face.
111 Charisma was OBVIOUSLY your dump stat!
112 You have the dexterity of a rhino! And only half the looks!
113 You are going to make an excellent belt! (any creature with hide or scales)
114 You're so ugly when you take a bath the water makes a reflex save! With advantage! Who are we kidding, you don't bathe!
116 Alright guys pour on the fire damage! Wait, what? Oh no, nevermind he's not an actual troll.
117 Oh god the smell! Elderberries would be an improvement!
118 I don't know whether to charm person or beast!
119 You're the reason baby gnomes cry!
120 If you had any more teeth... you'd have one!
121 No loot is worth having to look at you!
122 Your challenge rating has to be in the negatives.
123 You kleptomaniacal, self righteous, oversized gila monster!(to a dragon)
124 You orcs are so poor your shields are on layaway!
125 Your fighting stance looks like an unfolded lawn chair!
126 You are so damn clumsy your 0 level spells are called willtrips!
127 Your lack of personal hygene doesn't require a perception check!
128 You are irrelevant to the main plotline!
129 Do you even have a name? You are so dead.
130 Do you even have a last name? Hahaha didn't think so!
131 You are a one demensional character that lacks even a generic backstory!
132 It takes you 45 days to cook minute rice!
133 My milkshakes bring all the boys to the yard! Damn right they're better than yours!
134 You are the feces that is created, when shame eats too much stupidity!
135 You aren't important enough for a specific insult!
136 You aren't being the person Mr. Rodgers thought you could be!
137 You monolog like a subpar 60's batman villan!
138 Your doomsday device looks like it was built by ikea!
139 You're a disapointment to your ancestors!
140 You swing like a halfling!
141 If I knew darkvision ment I still had to look at your ugly mug at night I'd have rolled human!
142 I've seen more threatening geckos.
143 Why don't you summon yourself some real friends? (Magic User)
144 Wow... You're amazing! Wait... No, what's the opposite of amazing? Oh, yeah, shit! You're shit at this!
